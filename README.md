# Neo

This is Neo's master repository, only created for managing/monitoring the development process of each of Neo's components and to hold the documentation. No actual code will be pushed to this repository but rather to their counterpart repos @festivaledu/neo-core, @festivaledu/neo-server etc.  
  
In order to access all of this repo's content, issue.sh is necessary.
